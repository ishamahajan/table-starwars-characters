# Getting Started with table-starwars-characters

This project was developed using ReactJS, CSS.

## Components
The main component is the table, navigation button (Back and Next) and a detail container which is visible and populated when table row is clicked.
## How it works

On project launch, the first page data is read (from /swapi.dev/api/people/) and the table is populated with StarWars characters data recieved. 
At the beginnning, only 'Next' button is visible. 
When user presses a row in the table, details (name, birth year, gender and list of films) of the clicked character is populated. 

When user clicks 'Next', characters' data is populated again and displayed.
